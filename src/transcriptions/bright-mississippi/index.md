I originally transcribed this solo back in 2017, but I was never entirely happy with it. Marsalis can play with such speed that even slowing the recording down to a glacial pace in Audacity didn&rsquo;t help. Instead I needed rely on my knowledge of improvisational idioms, the mechanics of trumpet playing, and gut instinct. Even with all of that, I can&rsquo;t guarantee that this is 100% accurate: it&rsquo;s my best approximation after many, many revisions, but without a video of Wynton&rsquo;s fingers from the night this was recorded, there will always be a little bit of doubt.

Compare this section from the original recording at full speed

to a virtual playback of the transcription.

It sounds&hellip; close. Definitely in terms of melodic contour I&rsquo;m satisfied; and once the shape is correct, filling in the notes can be done somewhat automatically by looking at the chords and making an educated guess about what would make sense to go over them. Slowing it down, though, reveals some additional wrinkles. Here&rsquo;s the original recording again at half-speed

and for completeness, here&rsquo;s my transcription at half-speed.

In my attempt to notate and &ldquo;square off&rdquo; the rougher edges of the recording, I __do__ think that there are some notes that get lost in the mix. But we&rsquo;re talking about hundredths of a second here, and in the broader context of making this transcription a useful learning tool I think there&rsquo;s a balance to be struck between absolute accuracy and utility to a developing musician.
