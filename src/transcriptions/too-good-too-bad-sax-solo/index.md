Not a whole lot to say here, just a solid minute of absolutely killing it over the _Chameleon_ bassline. This was always one of my favorites from the first companion soundtrack, and I&rsquo;m happy I could finally transcribe it. There is one bit of mystery here, which is that I can&rsquo;t find definitive attribution for who actually performed the solo. [Masato Honda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masato_Honda) is very well known for his solo on the album&rsquo;s opener [Tank!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhq5zg6s1jo) but I can&rsquo;t say for certain that he&rsquo;s the soloist here.

A PDF of the transcription is available [here](/transcriptions/too-good-too-bad-sax-solo/too-good-too-bad-sax-solo.pdf).
