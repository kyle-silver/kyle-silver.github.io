A short, light piece that plays with fast and irregular time signatures. I originally wrote this piece in 2011 and revisited it ten years later to reflect what I&rsquo;ve learned in the intervening years. When I was originally writing this in [Noteflight](https://www.noteflight.com) I had a lot of fun with the transposition tool, and the result was a preponderance of ascending sequences, hence: &ldquo;Flight&rdquo;.
