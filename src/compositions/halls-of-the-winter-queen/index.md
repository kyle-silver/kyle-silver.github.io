I&rsquo;m part of a lovely Dungeons and Dragons campaign run by my friend [Griffin Poole](http://griffinpoole.com), and in early 2021 I wrote some ambient tracks to be an underscore for our sessions. D&D is so wonderfully flexible when it comes to the tone you want to set for a campaign, and for this one the main thing that struck me was the sense of scale: the settings were breathtakingly vast and unfathomably ancient. I wanted to capture some of that feeling in these pieces.

For _Planewalking_, I always imagined our party traveling over a vast expanse of grassland, perhaps along a path that had been worn from hundreds of years of foot and cart traffic. A sense of apprehension fills the air as the sun sets.

The next piece, _Cavern_, has some elements of horror scoring. There&rsquo;s an extreme separation of register, an eerie use of space, and a juxtaposition of very fragile melodic fragments against the grime and rumble of the bass and harmony. My hope with this piece is to convey a sense of apprehension and uncertainty, like what you and your party might feel when descending into the depths of a dungeon. The call-and-response &ldquo;echo&rdquo; effect is a nod to Mussorgsky&rsquo;s [Catacombs](https://youtu.be/bF30XA3OUEQ?t=2741) from [Pictures at an Exhibition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictures_at_an_Exhibition).

With _Forest_, I imagined traveling through a hazy and mysterious bit of woodland or marshland. Things in the distance shimmer and glisten; you and your party have completely lost track of where you are or what time it is.

The final piece, _Castle_, is the theme for a dwarven city. They are a proud people and herald the return of their wayward kin with a joyous fanfare of horns and drums. Unlike the other pieces in the set, which are for electronic instruments, _Castle_ is written for eight brass players and Timpani. A score and parts can be made available upon request.
