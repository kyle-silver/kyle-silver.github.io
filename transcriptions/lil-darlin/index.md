This one was a little bit tricky to get right. The individual notes and harmony weren&rsquo;t too bad, but the laid-back rhythmic feel at this slow of a tempo made it difficult to square the emotive and bluesy playing into the neat and orderly grid of western notation. A transcription can never capture the what truly makes a solo special&mdash;it can maybe get you 75 percent of the way there. The hope is that by transcribing you can focus more on that last 25 percent.

A PDF of this solo is available [here](lil-darlin-trumpet-solo-snooky-young.pdf). The rhythms and chords have been updated slightly from what&rsquo;s in the video to better reflect the solo (like I said, transcription is an imperfect science).
