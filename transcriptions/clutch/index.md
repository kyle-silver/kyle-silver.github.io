This is one of my favorites from the entire soundtrack. It&rsquo;s a throwback to the hard-bop, small-ensemble style of Horace Silver, Art Blakey, and Dexter Gordon&mdash;and Tomonao Hara really captures a lot of the magic that makes this a really thrilling solo. I had a ton of fun transcribing this one.

One thing that I love about this composition is how it riffs on _Kind of Blue_. The chord progression spends a long time alternating between D minor and <span class="flat">E&flat;</span> minor&mdash;just like in _Kind of Blue_&mdash;but instead of a slow, laid-back swing, the tempo has been cranked up to over 300 beats per minute.

A PDF of the solo is available for download [here](clutch-trumpet-solo-transcription-b-flat.pdf).
